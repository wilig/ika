# IKA

### Welcome to the IKA language page.

Ika is a new programming language who's main purpose to teach its author more about creating a programming language.  As such it's currently not really useful for much of anything other then watching its author work really hard to gain a clue.

## Driving principals

- Be simple, the author is easily confused.
- Be pragmatic, favor good enought over perfect.
- Be performant, try to waste less resources.
- Give good error messages, see point one.
- Offer safety, that can be escaped when needed.
- Offer useful abstractions around concurrency.

## Implementation

The "implementation" is currently still quite hypothetical.  It's currently using Zig, but that is subject to change at any time.  Zig is in the sweet spot for this kind of experiment, despite faily awful error messaging.  If I ever manage to wrangle a Jai invite, it may move in that direction.
