# IKA

### Welcome to the IKA language page.

Ika is a new programming language whose main purpose is to teach its author more about creating a programming language.  As such, it's currently not useful for much of anything other than watching its author work hard to gain a clue.

## Driving principals

- Be simple, the author is easily confused.
- Be pragmatic, favor good enought over perfect.
- Be performant, try to waste less resources.
- Give good error messages, see point one.
- Offer safety, that can be escaped when needed.
- Offer useful abstractions around concurrency.

## Implementation

The "implementation" is currently still quite hypothetical.  It's currently using --Zig-- C, but that is subject to change at any time.  The project has moved to C, as Zig was a bit too raw just yet.
